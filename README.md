# Overview

This project is to analyst NBA player's statues. I grabbed a table and clean it. According to the tidy data, I use pandas to present my ideas.

I also made a plot to help the user visualize.

# Data Analysis Results

* I wonder if Nikola Jokic is a consistent player. If he stays longer, will his percentage drop?

His field goal percentage does not drop, so he is a consistent player.

* Filter the table when the field goal percentage is greater than 50% and less than 50%, and see the difference.

When his FG% is less than 50%, he has more rebounds. When he cannot score, we do not need to worry. He still can get more rebounds and conduct the team.
